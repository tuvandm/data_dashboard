# data_dashboard
An interactive dashboard for business intelligence using machine learning

This is a custom data dashboard for a subscription based e-commerce company. 
It tracks 2 main KPIs (churn/retention and average gross profit after X months.
Using a machine learning model that is trained on sales data and detailed 
demographic data imported from social media via digital marketing coupon codes,
the dashboard also predicts who will be canceling their subscription in the
next 30 days. Finally, it also lets the user select specific cohorts in order
to get a break down on that cohort (which campaigns did they come from). This
allows the user to identify which traits lead to better ROI and/or better
retention. It also allows for a more sophisticated look at average aquisition
cost from a campaign vs lifetime profit value (a campaign with a very high cost of
aquisition may actually have excellent ROI due to that populations buying behaviour)


Note: while much of the data has been scrambled for privacy reasons, the underlying
relations and structure of the data remain true; person X did buy thing Y on date Z.
